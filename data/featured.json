            "It was born while I was finishing my PhD thesis, as I needed a tool to design the diagrams and figures to include in it. I tried several existing tools, but none of them fit my needs perfectly. I wanted something that was simple, fast, and easy to use, without the clutter of unnecessary features or a complex interface. Finally, I decided to build it myself.",
